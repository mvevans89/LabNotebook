## What was I up to today?

`AEDES` fixed the scrape. Will rerun for everything overnight. Uploaded more PAHO data.

`GIS` installed ArcGIS on the lab machine

`ICON` uploaded background documents

`8910` Compiled Lit Review Sheet

`FLAV` met with John for flavivirus project. Compiled list of viruses and some traits.

`SCORE` reran with distance to lake log transformed.  It helped the normality, but didn't change analyses. All the covariates are normally distributed.

## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`AEDES` upload more PAHO data 

`SCORE` analysis and interaction maps (leaflet? plotly? all other things?)

`FLAV` pair mosquitos with virus data


## What should I be doing long term?

`GIS` project brainstorming

* Coursera Biostats course

* stop being a fool and learn LaTeX
