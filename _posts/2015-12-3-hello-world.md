[Tad](https://taddallas.github.io/LabNotebook/) finally convinced me to try out this fancy github lab notebook thing. If anything it has finally gotten me to learn git language (sorta), which is something I have had on my to-do list for a while. Also, it should hopefully help me manage my time and leaves a history of it for future-me to see just what exactly I did with my afternoon today.

## What was I up to today?

* Took ECOLO 8310 Exam (killed it!)

* ICON I Response

* Made this whole lab notebook thing (and then spent two hours choosing the perfect color palette)

## What didn't I do today because I put it off until tomorrow?

* 8000 Term Paper

* Update `SCORE` project protocols
