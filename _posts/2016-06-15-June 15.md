## What was I up to today?

`urbanDengue` blood feeds using the Weaver method. Got about 100% feeding rates, so looking pretty good. Worked with Nikki on mosquito ID and wing mounts.

## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`zika` finish ms updates

* read paper for journal club

* update summer budget

* update protocols with new blood feeding

* SCORE meeting

`urbanDengue` clear out site 9 for larval surveys

## What should I be doing long term?

* maybe a real live dissertation topic? (forever, but not really)
