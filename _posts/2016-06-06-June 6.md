## What was I up to today?

`urbanDengue` harvested dengue virus. plated TCID-50's to check for titers later this week. prepped traps for starting adult surveys

`CHIKV` met to finalize our new covariate sampling method

## What should I be doing tomorrow?

* starting adult sampling

## What should I be doing long term?

* maybe a real live dissertation topic? (forever, but not really)
