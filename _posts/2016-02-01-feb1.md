## What was I up to today?

`AEDES` ran the WUnderground scrape.  It totally worked, but it will only let me grab one year's data with each call, so I added a pause and then rbind it all together in the end.  E-mailed Sadie with questions re: formatting.

`CLASS` so much class

`8910` summary

`SCORE` investigated GBM and random forest

## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`AEDES` upload more PAHO data 

`SCORE` analysis and interaction maps (leaflet? plotly? all other things?)

`ICON` upload background documents

`8910` Compile Lit Review Sheet

## What should I be doing long term?

`GIS` project brainstorming

* Coursera Biostats course

* stop being a fool and learn LaTeX
