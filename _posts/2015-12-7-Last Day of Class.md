Today was my last day of classes of my first semester of graduate school, so I naturally spent it rushing to finish all of my final assignments.

## What was I up to today?

* Said goodbye to my 2 1/2 hour Monday morning discussion class by making it 3 hrs. We did get donuts though

* Put the finishing touches on the 8000 paper, which meant I also had to do some major updates to my [Papers](http://www.papersapp.com/mac/) library so my citations would actually have authors names instead of _Butts, Seymour_

* Worked on the `SCORE` project some more for the official meeting with everyone tomorrow
+ downloaded SRTM data for altitude, but the rasters were so big when I `mosaic`-ed them all together, my tiny mac couldn't handle it
+ read some more papers on spatial GLMM and Bayesian geospatial modeling
+ found a great Youtube channel of the past [GeoStat Course](http://geostat-course.org/node) seminars, which should be a little helpful

## What should I be doing tomorrow

* Finish the `SCORE` protocols and then actually learn how to do them

* briefly look into smoothing data some more for my Friday meeting
