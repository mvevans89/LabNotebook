I've played with the idea of having an open lab notebook, and each time I convinced myself that it'd be a time sink, and something I'd grow disinterested in with time. However, here we are. I figured I'd give it a try. At best, it'll be a great way to keep my science (read as "scattered thoughts") a bit more organized. At worst, I'll abandon it after a bit. Either way, it's pretty straight-forward to mod if you'd like to have an open lab notebook. Simply fork or clone the Github repository, and set up a project repository like I have, with two branches; a main branch that contains a README, and a `gh-pages` branch that contains all the website materials. 

I'll provide a more in-depth intro to the website later, after I've had a chance to tweak it some more. 


The goal is to provide at least one post per week outlining goals, obstacles, thoughts, and achievements.
