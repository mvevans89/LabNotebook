## What did I work on today?

* Talked to Brian about cluster stuffs 

* Finalized rubric for lab exam 

* Started to subset `globalHelminth`; will need to run for awhile 

* Tiny edits, and file submission prep for `Competition` work (SPARC addendum)

* Class, etc. 





## What should I be working tomorrow?

* Push other `globalHelminth` projects along (consider pitching these data as a lab project)

* Threshold host density work (frustrating, but there's a solution I'm just missing)









---

### Keep in mind

* Start thinking about defense date (February?)
