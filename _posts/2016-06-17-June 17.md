## What was I up to today?

`CHIKV` went over some workflow with Reni

`urbanDengue` collected live Oak leaves and put them in the drying oven for larval water. Started growing some extra dengue virus.

* met with Mike Strand et al. to discuss collaborations between our summer field work and his lab

`zika` worked on updating format and content. Uploaded to Overleaf.


## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`zika` finish ms updates

* update protocols with new blood feeding

## What should I be doing long term?

* maybe a real live dissertation topic? (forever, but not really)
