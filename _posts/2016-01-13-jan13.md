## What was I up to today?

* `SCORE`: quick meeting with secretariat to get feedback on most recent maps
  
* `AthensMosq` : created R Markdown file for all the microclimate data visualization and updated plots to include through Dec. 15 2015

* `GSS`: some more practice, but I _think_ my presentation is good to go

## What should I be doing tomorrow

* Work on SCORE data and try out glmnet

* get the `AthensMosq` on github

* respond to e-mail about collaborating on Aedes spp. thermal-trait Lit Review

## What should I be doing long term?

* Coursera Biostats course

* stop being a fool and learn LaTeX
