## What was I up to today?

* `SCORE`: found higher resolution MODIS data that is taken every 8 days
  + downloaded data using OakRidge Subset web interface becuase it's much smaller,   manageable sizes than whole tiles
  + created a function that reads in each file and composes annual CSV's of LST data by month for each village point
  + also, found out you shouldn't query USGS sites too much, or they will block you ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


## What should I be doing tomorrow

* Finishing touches on presentation

* Learning about the sweet new microscope we got

* Update `SCORE` protocols

* Update R Markdown file for `SCORE`

## What should I be doing long term?

* Coursera Biostats course

* stop being a fool and learn LaTeX
