## What was I up to today?

* Finished up the __shiny__ tutorial

* Created a template for the `SCORE` leaflet map to fit into a shiny app, now just waiting on the actual data to see how to integrate the ability to choose starting prevalence criteria and binning

Here's what I have so far:

```{r}
runGitHub("score-app", "mvevans89")
```

* Update the `SCORE` protocol

## What should I be doing tomorrow

* briefly look into smoothing data some more for my Friday meeting
