## What was I up to today?

*old `weatherData` package I used to use to download Wunderground data is now defunct, so wrote some new code to do it.  Could I just make this into a new package to replace the old one?

## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`urbanDengue` protocols

`8030` reading

`8910` reading

`zika` manuscript

## What should I be doing long term?

* summer field plans

`FLAV` supplementary material

* fleshed out research plan
