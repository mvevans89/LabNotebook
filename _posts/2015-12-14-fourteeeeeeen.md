## What was I up to today?

* worked on the `SCORE` project
  + plotted coverage, prevalence and intensity by year
  + also plotted 'hotspot'/MDA resistance for Arms 1 and 4

## What should I be doing tomorrow

* look over smoothing data

* draft of spatial modeling of tanzania data

* think of a way to incorporate intensity into the hotspot analysis
