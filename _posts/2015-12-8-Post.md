Today was spent working on the `SCORE` project.

## What was I up to today?

* Attended a conference call with all of the _SCORE_ members

* Began working on an interactive map using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) & __shiny__ so that the SCORE team can analyze what criteria is appropriate for deeming a village a 'hotspot', ie resistant to MDA treatment

* took my first trip to the library!

## What should I be doing tomorrow

* Finish the `SCORE` protocols and then actually learn how to do them

* Keep looking into the shiny/leaflet combo

* briefly look into smoothing data some more for my Friday meeting
