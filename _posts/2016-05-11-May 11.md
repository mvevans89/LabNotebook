## What was I up to today?

* mosquito collection in Augusta

## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`urbanDengue` extract environmental data for the sites and run some models

* annual report for grad school

## What should I be doing long term?

* prepping for summer field work (soon!)

* maybe a real live dissertation topic? (forever, but not really)
