## What was I up to today?

* Finished my GSS Presentation
  + made new figures of population growth
  
* Explored how to download and read MODIS data in R
  + [MODISTools](https://github.com/seantuck12/MODISTools/) works best so far
  + [MODISDownload](http://r-gis.net/?q=ModisDownload) is giving me all kinds of     trouble

## What should I be doing tomorrow

* Coursera [Biostats Bootcamp](https://www.coursera.org/learn/biostatistics)

* Working versions of MODIS data for rainfall and temperature

## What should I be doing long term?

* SESYNC SES Statistics App
