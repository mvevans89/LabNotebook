## What was I up to today?

`FLAV` did some old-school research at the library. still filling the matrix

`SCORE` played around with GBM in `dismo` and `gbm`.  Both seem to agree that rainfall is an important environmental covariate, with villages with low rainfall being more resistant to MDA.

`CHIKV` read some more methods for our project


## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`AEDES` upload more PAHO data 

`SCORE` analysis and interaction maps (leaflet? plotly? all other things?)

`FLAV` pair mosquitos with viruses


## What should I be doing long term?

`GIS` project brainstorming

* Coursera Biostats course

* stop being a fool and learn LaTeX
 
* Drake Lab Blog post (maybe some kind of interactive mapping? or a less lame idea?)
