## What was I up to today?

`AEDES` started updating all the PAHO data.  Seems like is definitely cumulative by epidemic week.  Should take ~10 hours to get it all up.

`8910` mapped out the data we got from John to see how incomplete it is

`EBOV` heard back from M. BAH about work on chiroptera and zooonoses

## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`GIS` finish HW

`AEDES` check out the Wunderground scrape and upload more PAHO data

`8910` readings for the week

## What should I be doing long term?

* Coursera Biostats course

* stop being a fool and learn LaTeX

`GIS` project brainstorming
