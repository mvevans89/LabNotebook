## What was I up to today?

`urbanDengue` collected our first five taps and set out the second four. Got permission for the larval surveys.

`CHIKV` nearly finished with the raster processing

* prepping for infectious feeds

## What should I be doing tomorrow?

`urbanDengue` first round of dengue blood feeds

`CHIKV` trial run of new code

## What should I be doing long term?

* maybe a real live dissertation topic? (forever, but not really)
