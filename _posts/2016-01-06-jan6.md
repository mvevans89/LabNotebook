## What was I up to today?

* `SCORE`: downloaded MODIS data of land surface temperature, aggregated by month
  + created a function that stacks the rasters together and extracts the temperature at     each point, then creates an annual mean
  + function should be usuable for other raster data, too!
  
* jumped onto the #365papers bandwagon and read some papers (up to 3 so far, so only     behind by 3)

* Biostats course


## What should I be doing tomorrow

* Finish extracting temperature data

* Get rainfall data extracted too

## What should I be doing long term?

* Coursera Biostats course

* stop being a fool and learn LaTeX
