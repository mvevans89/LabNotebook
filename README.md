## Hello

You've found my open lab notebook. Hopefully it wasn't all that difficult. I will attempt to maintain this notebook for as long as I can, but it will likely serve different purposes over time. For now, I use it as a task management tool, in order to prioritize projects I need to push forward over others (i.e., it's basically a `to-do list` currently). Hopefully this will shift over time to being more informative to the external reader.


Feel free to fork the [sampleNotebook](https://github.com/taddallas/LabNotebook/tree/sampleNotebook) branch and set an open lab notebook up for yourself. It's good stuff.
